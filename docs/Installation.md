# Installation

## Install VS Code

Your first step is to install VS Code: 

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download an appropriate build for your platform.
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.

## Install the InterSystems ObjectScript Extensions

Next, you need to install the following extensions:

- InterSystems ObjectScript
- InterSystems Server Manager

Run VS Code. From within the application, click the extensions button in the Activity Bar on the left edge of the VS Code window:

![Extensions button.](../assets/images/extensions.png "extensions button")

Type `intersystems` in the search field to find these extensions in the Marketplace, as illustrated in the following screen shot:

![Search in Marketplace.](../assets/images/marketplace.png "search in marketplace")

For the ObjectScript and Server Manager extensions, click the **install** button. Note that the InterSystems ObjectScript extension supplies an ObjectScript button which appears in the Activity Bar when a workspace or folder is open:

![ObjectScript button.](../assets/images/objectscript.png "objectscript button")

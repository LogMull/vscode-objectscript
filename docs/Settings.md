# Settings

VS Code provides a number of settings that enable you to customize various aspects of its function. Many settings are general to VS Code, and you can learn about them in the [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). The InterSystems ObjectScript and InterSystems Server Manager extensions supply specific settings used to configure VS Code for ObjectScript development. You can learn more in the section [Configuration](../configuration).

There are several levels on which settings are stored and used:

- **User** - User settings are stored in a file location specific to you and apply globally to any instance of VS Code or any VS Code workspace that you open.
- **Workspace** - Workspace settings are stored in a file inside the workspace and apply to anyone who opens the workspace.
- **Folder** - If more than one folder is present in the workspace, you can select the folder where the settings file is stored by selecting from the Folder drop down list.

See the VS Code documentation section [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).
